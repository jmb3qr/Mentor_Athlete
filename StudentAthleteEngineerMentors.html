        <h4>Swimming & Diving</h4>
      <p>I originally wanted to go into bio-medical engineering. During my first year I had to go to several information sessions about different engineering disciplines, this showed me that chemical engineering was what I was interested in. I'm involved in the Chem-E car, which is a national competition between chemical engineering departments to design the best power source for a small vehicle. I'm planning on going into consulting when I graduate, but I'm open to taking a technical job as well.</p>

      <p>I knew I wanted to study mechanical engineering since I took my first physics class in high school, and having my older brother obtain his masters in this field cemented this decision as I now have a mentor/tutor I can contact whenever I need help.

      <p>Starting at UVA I didn't really know what I wanted to do other than I knew I was good at math and science. After taking the general first year engineering classes I realized that I wasn't interested in anything mechanical. Something that I have always liked has been problem solving and that is what kind of lead me to CS. I also have the intention of doing the business minor in the engineering school.</p>

      <p>Coming into college I was originally a student in the College of Arts and Sciences because I was told during the recruiting process that engineering paired with D1 athletics was too ambitious to complete in 4 years. After realizing my passion was in math and science, and specifically in design, I transferred into UVA's Civil Engineering program and have never looked back. I am also my team's SACH representative (student athletes committed to honor) and a member of ASCE (American society of civil engineers). I believe I want to work in the field of building construction, but I still am trying to figure out the specifics.</p>

I got my private pilot license in high school so it's been really interesting to learn about my passion from an engineer's perspective.

      <p>Even before joining the engineering program at UVa, I realized that I didnt want to be a typical engineer. However, after hearing more about the systems engineering degree, I realized how it shapes you for the business world ahead and more importantly teaches you how to think and solve problems. After school, I am looking for a consulting job, or a role at a financial firm. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions regarding systems engineering or just balancing engineering with athletics!</p>
